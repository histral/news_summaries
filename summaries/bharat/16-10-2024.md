### Bharat’s Role in the Russia-Ukraine Conflict

Bharat’s [neutral stance]((Bharat has history being neutral in global conflicts)) in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is increasingly coming under global scrutiny, with both Russia and Italy suggesting the nation could play a key role in peace talks. While New Delhi has maintained neutrality, its strategic interests in both Russia and the West make its future moves critical to resolving the crisis.

> [!NOTE]
> Bharat has abstained from several key UN votes regarding the conflict.

> [!QUESTION]
> How might Bharat’s neutrality impact its future relations with both Russia and
> Western allies?

[[Bharat's neutral stance is due to its historical commitment to non-alignment and its close ties with both Russia and the West. The country has sought to balance its interests by maintaining good relations with both sides, but its neutrality has been criticized by some who argue that Bharat should take a more active role in resolving the conflict.  The implications of Bharat's neutrality are significant. The country could lose the trust of both sides, which could jeopardize its future relationships with both Russia and the West. On the other hand, Bharat's neutrality could be seen as a strength, allowing the country to act as a mediator between the two sides. Ultimately, Bharat's future role in the conflict will depend on its strategic interests and its ability to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape. ]]
