| "The greatest game in the world." - John Arlott

Today in the cricket world, Bharat's captain Rohit Sharma is facing a critical decision regarding the fitness of star bowler Mohammed Shami. With an upcoming tour of Australia looming, Sharma is cautious about rushing Shami's return, ensuring he is at peak fitness before taking on the challenging five-Test series.  

Meanwhile, the first Test between Bharat and New Zealand is set to begin in Bengaluru, bringing with it a wave of anticipation and potential for exciting matches. Bharat, currently leading the ICC World Test Championship points table, will be looking to solidify their position and build momentum for the Australian tour. 

### Bharat's Tour of Australia

> [!NOTE]
> The Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a highly anticipated series between Bharat and Australia, is set to begin in November 2024.
