| "Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties." - Sir Don Bradman ((Famous cricketer and one of the greatest batsmen of all time))

Today in the cricket world,  Kamindu Mendis stole the spotlight with a brilliant century, leading Sri Lanka to a strong total of 302/7 on Day 1 of the first Test against New Zealand. Looking ahead, Bharat’s captain Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli are set to lead the team in a two-Test series against Bangladesh starting September 19, as they aim to continue their dominant run in the longest format.  Exciting times lie ahead for cricket fans! 

### Bharat's Historic Test Loss to New Zealand

New Zealand has achieved a historic victory by defeating Bharat in a Test series on Bharat’s home soil for the first time in 36 years. This victory ended Bharat’s streak of 18 consecutive Test series wins at home, a record that stood for 12 years.

> [!NOTE] 
> The last time Bharat lost a Test series at home was in 2012-13, when England won 2-1.

> [!QUESTION] 
> What factors contributed to Bharat’s unexpected loss? Are there any underlying issues with Bharat’s Test team that need to be addressed?

### The Impact of the Loss on Bharat's Test Ranking

The series loss has significantly affected Bharat’s position in the World Test Championship (WTC) points table. They are now at risk of missing out on a spot in the WTC final, especially if other teams perform well in their upcoming matches. 

> [!NOTE] 
> Bharat needs to win at least four out of their remaining six Test matches to have a strong chance of qualifying for the WTC final.

> [!QUESTION] 
> How will this loss impact Bharat’s chances of winning the WTC? Will this series loss be a wake-up call for the team, leading to improvements in the future? 

###  The Emerging Players of Bharat's Team

Despite the series loss, some young players performed well. Yashasvi Jaiswal, a 22-year-old opener, set a new record by scoring the most runs by an Indian debutant in a Test series. He also became the first Indian to score a century on Test debut since Prithvi Shaw in 2018.

> [!NOTE]
> Jaiswal’s success is a sign of the potential within Bharat’s young players. He has the potential to become a key player for Bharat in the coming years.

> [!QUESTION] 
> Can Jaiswal and other young players like Akash Deep and Harshit Rana, who were selected for the upcoming tour of Australia,  carry forward the momentum and become consistent performers in the Test format?

### The Future of Bharat's Test Team

This series loss has exposed some vulnerabilities in Bharat's Test team, particularly in handling spin-friendly conditions. Bharat’s captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that the team needs to have a “quiet chat” with some of the players and discuss their performances. The team needs to address these issues and work on its weaknesses to regain its dominance in Test cricket.

> [!NOTE]
>  The upcoming tour of Australia is a crucial test for Bharat’s Test team. It will be interesting to see how they perform in such demanding conditions.

> [!QUESTION]
> Will Bharat be able to bounce back from this series loss and put up a strong performance in Australia? Can they regain their confidence and adapt to different playing conditions?
