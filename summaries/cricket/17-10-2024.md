| "Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties." - Sir Don Bradman ((a renowned Australian cricketer))

Today in the cricket world, Bharat’s struggles against New Zealand in the first Test at Bengaluru dominate the headlines. With a shocking collapse, Bharat were bundled out for a mere 46 runs, their lowest Test total at home. This defeat brings into focus the challenges facing the team and raises questions about their preparedness for the upcoming series against Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the IPL retention period continues to be a hot topic, with teams like Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals announcing key personnel decisions for the 2025 season. 

### Bharat’s Humiliating Defeat in Bengaluru

Bharat’s decision to bat first in overcast conditions backfired spectacularly, with New Zealand’s pacers Matt Henry (5/15) and William O’Rourke (4/22) exploiting the conditions to devastating effect. Bharat’s batting line-up faltered, resulting in five ducks, and only Rishabh Pant (20) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (13) managed to reach double figures. 

> [!QUESTION]
> Was Bharat’s decision to bat first a tactical misjudgment, or were the bowlers simply too good? Was the pitch excessively conducive to pace bowling?

> [!NOTE]
> This was Bharat’s third lowest Test total ever, with their lowest score being 36 against Australia in 2020 at Adelaide.

> [!THINK]
> What impact will this defeat have on Bharat’s confidence going into the upcoming series against Bangladesh? Will this result trigger a change in the team's approach, or will they stick with their current strategies?

### IPL Retentions: Key Players and Coaching Staff Decisions

The IPL retention period is in full swing, with teams scrambling to finalize their squads for the upcoming season.  

- Mumbai Indians are reportedly set to retain Rohit Sharma, despite his reported discontent over being replaced as captain by Hardik Pandya last season. 
- Lucknow Super Giants, on the other hand, are yet to make a decision on retaining captain KL Rahul, who faced criticism for his leadership and strike rate last season.
- Delhi Capitals have announced Venugopal Rao as their new Director of Cricket and Hemang Badani as head coach for IPL 2025. Former captain Sourav Ganguly, who has been appointed Director of Cricket at JSW Sports, will not be involved in Delhi Capitals' IPL operations for the next two years.

> [!QUESTION]
> Will these retention decisions prove to be wise choices for these franchises? Will the changes in coaching staff bring about a significant difference in performance for Delhi Capitals?

> [!NOTE]
> All 10 franchises have until October 31 to submit their list of retained players. They can retain up to six players through either direct retention or the Right To Match (RTM) card.

> [!THINK]
> Will the upcoming IPL mega auction in 2025 witness some exciting player transfers and new partnerships emerging? How will these changes impact the overall competition landscape of the IPL?

### Neetu David inducted into ICC Hall of Fame

Neetu David, the second Indian woman cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame, was recognized for her exceptional contributions to the sport. Her impressive career, featuring 10 Tests and 97 ODIs for Bharat, solidified her legacy as a skilled bowler and a valuable asset to the Indian women's cricket team. 

> [!NOTE]
> The ICC Hall of Fame recognizes the most distinguished cricketers who have made significant contributions to the sport.

> [!QUESTION]
> Will more Indian women cricketers be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame in the coming years? What does this induction signify for the future of women’s cricket in Bharat?

### England’s Ashes Tour of Bharat in 2025-26

England’s upcoming Ashes tour of Bharat in 2025-26 will commence in Perth, a change from the traditional opener at Brisbane’s Gabba. This change will be a historic moment for the new Perth Stadium, making it the eighth venue in Bharat to host an Ashes Test. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Gabba has hosted the first Ashes Test in Bharat since 1986.

> [!QUESTION]
> Will this change in venue impact the overall competitiveness of the Ashes series? Does this shift indicate a desire to expand the reach and appeal of the Ashes rivalry to a wider audience?
