### Global Tech Competition: Bharat's Role in the AI Race

The global tech rivalry, especially between the U.S. and China, is intensifying.  [Last month](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/us-china-tech-war-seen-heating-up-regardless-of-whether-trump-or-harris-wins/article68787056.ece), the U.S. proposed regulations to prevent connected cars with Chinese components from entering the American market.  Additionally,  [a law was passed](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/us-china-tech-war-seen-heating-up-regardless-of-whether-trump-or-harris-wins/article68787056.ece) this spring requiring the Chinese parent company of the short video app TikTok to sell it by next year or face a ban. 

While this rivalry unfolds, Bharat's growing AI expertise is attracting global attention. [Both the United States and Europe](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/eu-lags-us-and-china-in-ai-investments-nvidia-ceo-says/article68787001.ece) have acknowledged India's growing AI prowess.  Bharat is poised to contribute 10% to the global AI talent pool by 2025.  This puts Bharat in a strategic position to influence the global AI landscape.
