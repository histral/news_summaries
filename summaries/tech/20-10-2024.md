## Bharat's Antitrust Battles in the App Economy

### Epic Games vs. Google and Apple: A Tale of Two Outcomes

Epic Games' [legal battles](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/did-google-violate-antitrust-laws-in-epic-battle/article68773648.ece) with Google and Apple highlight the complexities of antitrust regulations in the burgeoning app economy.  Epic, the developer of the popular game *Fortnite*, challenged both companies' policies on in-app purchases, arguing that their commission fees and restrictive practices were anti-competitive. 

Epic's strategy was to bypass Google and Apple's payment systems, allowing players to make purchases directly through the game. However, both companies retaliated by removing *Fortnite* from their respective app stores. 

While Epic's case against Apple was successful in some aspects, the lawsuit against Google had a different outcome.  In Apple's case, a judge ruled that Apple was not a monopoly, but acknowledged some anti-competitive practices. On the other hand, the Google case has not yet reached a verdict.
